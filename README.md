# Basic server Shell CLI

This repository complements the [React CLI Component](https://github.com/Pervolarakis/react-cli-component), allowing users to host their customizable filesystems online. This server-side implementation, built using Socket.io, enables the "WebSocket Support" branch of the CLI component to communicate with remote filesystems, facilitating real-time interactions and file management.

It offers a basic fully editable filesystem and 4 basic shell commands like:
cd, ls, cat, help
